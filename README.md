## Installing the extension
To install the extension unpacked in your browser, follow these general instructions. Please note that the specific steps may vary slightly depending on the browser you are using.

Download the unpacked extension files from github

If the extension is in a ZIP format, extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
If the extension is in a CRX format, change the file extension from .crx to .zip, and then extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
Enable Developer Mode in Your Browser:

Open your browser and access the extension settings. The method to access these settings varies depending on the browser you are using.
Look for an option called "Developer Mode" or "Extensions Developer Mode" and enable it. This mode allows you to install extensions manually.

After enabling Developer Mode, you should see an option to "Load unpacked" or "Load extension" appear in the settings. Click on that option.
A file dialog will open, prompting you to select the folder where you extracted the extension files. Navigate to the folder and click "Select" or "Open."
The browser will install the extension from the selected folder. Once installed, you should see the extension's icon appear in your browser's toolbar or extension menu.
